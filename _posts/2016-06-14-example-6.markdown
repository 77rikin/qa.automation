Selenium defines different timeouts and wait mechanisms. One of the timeouts is focused on the time a web-page need to be loaded - the pageLoadTimeout limits the time that the script allots for web page to be displayed.

If the page loads within the time then the script continues.
If the page does not load within the timeout the script will be stopped by a TimeoutException.

`_how to set the timeout`
The timeout is set at the driver level.After creating the driver instance (for RED) with the appropriate capabilities.
See the code below for an example of setting the timeout. The default is a 30 second timeout!

{% highlight ruby %}
driver.manage().timeouts().pageLoadTimeout(40, TimeUnit.SECONDS);
  // Use the timeout when navigating to a webpage
  try {
      driver.get(myWebPage);
      driver.findElementByXpath(verificationField);
  } catch (TimeoutException e) {
      System.out.println("Page: " + myWebPage + " did not load within 40 seconds!");
      // treat the timeout as needed
  }
{% endhighlight %}
