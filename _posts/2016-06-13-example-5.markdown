When a page is loaded by the brwoser the element whcih we want to intract with may load at different time intervals. This makes diddicult to identify the element and if element is not lacated it will throw an "ElementNotVisibleException" exception.

Using waits, we can resolve this problem.


To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
