`Inheritance`
Inheritance is one such concept where the properties/behavior(variable and method) of once can be inherited by the other.
The class who is getting properites is know as child class (sub class or derived class) and the class who si providing properties is know as parent class (supper class or based class).

Concept of inheritance is also know as is-a replationship(means two classes are sharing same hierarchy)
By using extends Keyword we are achiving inheritance.

{% highlight ruby %}
class Parent {
// having properties like home,bank balance, land

}

class Child extend Parent{

// will automatically having access of all Parent properties like
// home,bank balance, land and child own properties as well.

}

{% endhighlight %}

_different type of inheritance
`Single inheritance`
{% highlight ruby %}
 class A{} <---- class B extends A{}
  {% endhighlight %}
 getting properties form single parent to child is single inheritance.
 
 `Multilevel inheritance`
 {% highlight ruby %}
 class A{} <--- class B extends A{}  <--- class C extends B{}
 {% endhighlight %}
one super class and one sublcss at every level is called mulilevel inheritance.
